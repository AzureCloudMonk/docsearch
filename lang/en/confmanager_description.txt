The DocSearch plugin allows you to search through your uploaded documents.
It is integrated into the default DokuWiki search.
Just fill in a search string and start to search.

DocSearch needs external tools to convert a specific file type to plain text.
Place the file extension in the Key column and the convert tool in the right.
When a file with the specific extension is found the according tool will be used.

DocSearch needs to tell the convert tool the path of the file to convert and the target to place the text file.
This is done via placeholders. %in% is the source file and %out% is the target file.
The generated text file must be UTF-8.

An example:
  /usr/bin/pdftotext -enc UTF-8 %in% %out%
